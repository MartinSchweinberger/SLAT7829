# Basic Concepts in Corpus Linguistics and Text Analysis

This session introduces basic concepts in corpus linguistics and text analysis.

## Glossary of Important Concepts {-}

Below, you will find explanations of concepts and methods that are important in Text Analysis and also links to relevant resources (including LADAL tutorials).

**Word**

What a word is is actually very tricky. For instance, How many words are there in this sentence?

> The cat sat on the mat
One answer is that there are six words; that is, there are six *groups of characters* which are separated according to typographical convention. But there is another answer: There are five words, that is five *distinct sequences* of characters and one of those sequences (the) occurs twice. The terms commonly used to make this distinction are **type** and **token**. Tokens are instances of types, therefore if we count tokens, we count without considering repetition, while if we count types, we do consider repetition. In our example, there are five types (the, cat, sat, on, mat) but six tokens, because there are two tokens of one of the types (the).

There is a further distinction we may need to make which we can see if we consider another question: are *cat* and *cats* the same word? They are distinct types, and therefore must also be distinct as tokens. But we have an intuition that at some level they are related, that there is some more abstract item which underlies both of them. This concept is usually referred to as a **lemma**.

```

**Concordancing**

In Text Analysis, concordancing refers to the extraction of words from a given text or texts [@lindquist2009corpus]. Commonly, concordances are displayed in the form of key-word in contexts (KWIC) where the search term is shown with some preceding and following context. Thus, such displays are referred to as key word in context concordances. A more elaborate tutorial on how to perform concordancing with R is available [here](https://slcladal.github.io/kwics.html). If you do not want to use coding to extract concordances, a highly recommendable tool for extracting concordances (and many other TA tasks) is [AntConc](https://www.laurenceanthony.net/software/antconc/). 

Concordancing is helpful for seeing how the term is used in the data, for inspecting how often a given word occurs in a text or a collection of texts, for extracting examples, and it also represents a basic procedure and often the first step in more sophisticated analyses of language data. 


**Corpus (pl. Corpora)**

A corpus is a machine readable and electronically stored collection of natural language texts representing writing or speech chosen to be characteristic of a variety or the state of a language [see @sinclair1991corpus]. Corpora are great for extracting examples of natural examples and testing research hypotheses as it is easy to obtain information on frequencies, grammatical patterns, or collocations and they are commonly publicly available so the research results can be contrasted, compared and repeated.

There are four main types of corpora:

1. **Monitor corpora**: large collections of texts from different genres/modes that aim at representing a language or language variety, e.g., [*International Corpus of English* (ICE)](https://www.ice-corpora.uzh.ch/en.html), [*Corpus of Contemporary Corpus of American English* (COCA)](https://www.english-corpora.org/coca/), that are, e.g., used to analyse the use of certain linguistic phenomena or to investigate collocations of certain words/topics

2. **Learner corpora**: Contain data from language learners - these can be either L1 learners, e.g., [*Child Language Data Exchange System*  (CHILDES)](https://childes.talkbank.org/), and/or L2 learners, e.g., [the *International Corpus of Learner English* (ICLE)](https://uclouvain.be/en/research-institutes/ilc/cecl/icle.html)) - to study, e.g., how L1 and/or L2 speakers learn/acquire (aspects of) a language and to see how learners differ from native speakers.

3. **Historical or diachronic corpora**: Contain data from different points in time that allow to analyse the development of a language or language variety (e.g., [*Penn Parsed Corpora of Historical English*](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/hist-corpora/),[ *The Helsinki Corpus of English Texts*](http://icame.uib.no/hc/)) to study, e.g., how language changes or how genres develop over time.

4. **Specialized corpora**: Contain data representing a specific genre/text type (e.g., [*British Academic Written English Corpus* (BAWE)](https://www.coventry.ac.uk/research/research-directories/current-projects/2015/british-academic-written-english-corpus-bawe/)) to study, e.g., (linguistic) features of a genre (e.g. academic writing) or language in class rooms.

knitr::include_graphics("https://slcladal.github.io/images/collocates.png")
```


**Collocations**

Collocations are words that are attracted to each other (and that co-occur or co-locate together), e.g., *Merry Christmas*, *Good Morning*, *No worries*, or *Fuck off*. Collocations are important because any word in any given language has collocations, i.e., others words that are attracted to that word or words that that word is attracted to
allow us to anticipate what word comes next and collocations are context/text type specific. It is important to note that collocations to not have to appear/occur right next to each other but that other words can be in between. There are various different statistical measures are used to define the strength of the collocations, like the Mutual Information (MI) score and log-likelihood ([see here for an over view of different association strengths measures](http://www.collocations.de/AM/index.html)).


**Document Classification**

Document or Text Classification (also referred to as text categorization) generally refers to process of grouping texts or documents based on similarity. This similarity can be based on word frequencies or other linguistics features but also on text external features such as genre labels or polarity scores. 

**Document-Term Matrix**

Document-Term Matrices (DTM) and Term- Document Matrices (TDM) contain the frequencies of words per document. DTM and TDM differ in whether the words or the documents are represented as rows. Thus, the words (terms) are listed as row names and the documents represent the column names while the matrix itself contains the frequencies of the words in the documents.

```{r freq, echo=FALSE, out.width= "40%", out.extra='style="float:right; padding:10px"'}

```

**Frequency Analysis**

Frequency Analysis is a suit of methods which extract and compare frequencies of different words (tokens and/or types), collocations, phrases, sentences, etc. These frequencies are the often tabulated to show lists of words, phrases, etc. descending by frequency, visualized to show distributions, and/or compared and analyzed statistically to find differences between texts or collections fo texts.


**Keyword Analysis** 

Keyword Analysis refers to a suit of methods that allow to detect words that are characteristic of on text or collection of texts compared to another text/collection of texts. There are various keyness measures such as Log-Likelihood  or the term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency (tf-idf).

**Lemma (Lemmatization)**

Lemma refers to the base form of a word (example: *walk*, *walked*, and *walking* are word forms of the lemma *WALK*). Lemmatization refers to a annotation process in which word forms are associated with their base form (lemma). Lemmatization is a very common and sometimes useful processing step for further analyses. In contrast to stemming - which is a related process - lemmatization also takes into account semantic differences (differences in the word meaning), while stemming only takes the orthography of words into consideration.



**N-Gram**

N-grams are combinations/sequences of words, e.g. the sentence *I really like pizza!* has the bi-grams (2-grams): *I really*, *really like*, and *like pizza* and the tri-grams (3-grams) *I really like* and *really like pizza*. N-grams play an important part in natural language processing (e.g. part-of-speech tagging), language learning, psycholinguistics models of language production, and genre analysis. 


**Natural Language Processing**

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an interdisciplinary field in computer science that has specialized on processing natural language data using computational and mathematical methods. Many methods used in Text Analysis have been developed in NLP.


```{r net, echo=FALSE, out.width= "40%", out.extra='style="float:right; padding:10px"'}

```

**Network Analysis**

Network Analysis is the most common way to visualize relationships between entities. Networks, also called graphs, consist of nodes (typically represented as dots) and edges (typically represented as lines) and they can be directed or undirected networks.

In directed networks, the direction of edges is captured. For instance, the exports of countries. In such cases the lines are directed and typically have arrows to indicate direction. The thickness of lines can also be utilized to encode information such as frequency of contact.

**Part-of-Speech Tagging** 

Part-of-Speech (PoS) Tagging identifies the word classes of words (e.g., noun, adjective, verb, etc.) in a text and adds part-of-speech tags to each word. There are various part-of-speech tagsets, e.g. the Penn Treebank is the most frequently used tagset used for English. A more detailed tutorial on how to perform part-of-speech tagging in R can be found [here](https://slcladal.github.io/tagging.html).


**Project Gutenberg** 

The Project Gutenberg is a excellent resource for accessing digitized literary texts. The Project Gutenberg library contains over 60,000 ebooks that are out of copyright in the US. A tutorial on how to download texts form the Project Gutenberg library using the `GutenbergR` package can be found [here](https://slcladal.github.io/gutenberg.html).

**Regular Expression**

Regular Expressions - often simply referred to as regex - are symbols or sequence of symbols utilized to search for patterns in textual data. Regular Expressions are  very useful and widely used in Text Analysis and often different programming languages will have very similar but slightly different Regular Expressions. A tutorial on how to use regular expression in R can be found [here](https://slcladal.github.io/regex.html) and here is a link to a [regex in R cheat sheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/main/regex.pdf).

**Semantic Analysis** 

Semantic Analysis refers to a suit of methods that allow to analyze the semantic (semantics) fo texts. Such analyses often rely on semantic tagsets that are based on word meaning or meaning families/categories. Two examples of such semantic tagsets are the [URCEL tagset](https://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/claws7tags.html) and the [*Historical Thesaurus Semantic Tagger*](http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/115024/) [@alexander2015tagger] developed at the University of Glasgow.

```{r senti, echo=FALSE, out.width= "40%", out.extra='style="float:right; padding:10px"'}

```

**Sentiment Analysis** 

Sentiment Analysis is a computational approach to determine if words or texts are associated with (positive or negative) polarity or  emotions.Commonly, sentiments analyses  are based on sentiment dictionaries (words are annotated based on whether they occur in a list of words associated with, e.g., positive polarity or emotion, e.g., *fear*, *anger*, or *joy.* A tutorial on how to perform sentiment analysis in R can be found [here](https://slcladal.github.io/sentiment.html).

**String** 

In computational approaches, a string is a specific type of data that represents text and is often encoded in specific format, e.g., Latin1 or UTF8. Strings may also be present in other data types such as lists or data frames. A tutorial on how to work with strings in R can be found [here](https://slcladal.github.io/string.html).

**Term Frequencyâ€“Inverse Document Frequency (tf-idf)** 

Term Frequencyâ€“Inverse Document Frequency is a statistical measure of keyness which reflects how characteristic a word is of a specific text. Term Frequencyâ€“Inverse Document Frequency is based on the frequencies of words in a text compared to the frequency of documents in which it occurs

```{r topic, echo=FALSE, out.width= "40%", out.extra='style="float:right; padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://slcladal.github.io/images/topic.png")
```


**Topic Modeling** 

Topic modelling is a machine learning method seeks to answer the question: given a collection of documents, can we identify what they are *about*?

Topic model algorithms look for patterns of co-occurrences of words in documents. We assume that, if a document is about a certain topic, one would expect words that are related to that topic to appear in the document more often than in documents that deal with other topics. Topic model commonly use Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to find *topics* in textual data. 

There are two basic types of Topic models

* supervised or seeded topics models where the researchers provides seed terms around which the LDS looks for topics (collections of correlating terms)

* unsupervised or unseeded topic models which try to find a predefined number of topics (collections of correlating terms)
