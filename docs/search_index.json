This course introduces students to the study of texts using computers, commonly called text analysis or corpus linguistics. Over the past decades, corpus linguistics has emerged both as a field in its own right but also as an important methodology across the language sciences including studies on language acquisition and learning, language variation and change as well as language use. As such, text analysis and corpus linguistics have helped to place linguistic theorizing on a sounder empirical footing by allowing researchers to explore massive amounts of textual data, be it learner essays, transcriptions of dinner table conversation, or historical documents. This course covers the fundamental concepts, origins, and methods of corpus linguistics and text analysis with a focus on a hands-on approach and using specific examples of how corpora can be used in applied linguistic research. Course Introduction This is a postgraduate-level course on compiling corpora (collections of language samples), working with and analyzing texts using corpus linguistic methods, with a particular focus on the areas of language use, learning, and teaching. The course covers a wide variety of issues and topics related to corpus linguistics and text analysis such as the fundamental concepts, origins, and methods of corpus linguistics and text analysis, the focus is placed on a hands-on approach by exploring collections of texts, applying computational methods, and using specific examples of how corpora can be used in applied linguistic research. In so doing, it will motivate students to apply the skills and methods to a diverse set of textual data sources with a focus on learner data.

Aims, Objectives &amp; Graduate Attributes Course Aims The course aims to introduce corpus linguistics and text analysis with a particular focus on with a particular focus on the areas of language use, learning, and teaching. It will present the fundamental skills needed to plan and carry out analyses of language based on text samples (corpora). Students will learn to compile, work with, use, and explore collections of texts as well as how to apply computational methods in applied linguistic research. In so doing, it will motivate students to apply the skills and methods to a diverse set of textual data sources with a focus on learner data. Course assessments will provide the opportunity to apply these skills in relevant research tasks. Learning Objectives After successfully completing this course you should be able to: Describe and explain how language is used in different contexts Understanding of concepts and methods in text analysis and corpus linguistics Effectively apply the concepts and theories studied in the course to the analysis of language data (texts) Practically apply text analysis and corpus linguistics methods Critically evaluate analyses of language data Identify differences between learners and native speakers of English Learning Resources Required Resources Stefanowitsch, Anatol. 2020.

Weekly lecture content is either delivered face-to-face or consists of pre-recorded lectures that are uploaded to Blackboard one week before the scheduled week. Weekly tutorials are conducted face-to-face or online via Zoom following your scheduled timetable allocations. Throughout the semester you will be expected to contribute substantially and consistently to our tutorial activities and discussions of research approaches and methodologies drawing on your own ideas and experiences. Please make sure that you keep up with the course content by reviewing the online materials made available on Blackboard (e.g., lecture podcasts, lecture and tutorial slides, readings) and completing the assessments. Allocations usually take a few weeks to finalise so please be patient. Public Holidays 2023: If your tutorial falls on one of these, a make-up class will be held in the same or the following week - the dates and times for make up classes will be announced via Blackboard. Please wait for information about this.
