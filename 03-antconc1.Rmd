AntConc is a popular, free software program used for corpus linguistics analysis. It is designed to work with text corpora, which are large collections of written or spoken texts used for linguistic analysis.

AntConc offers a wide range of features that allow users to explore language use and patterns within a corpus, including tools for concordance analysis, collocation analysis, and keyword analysis. It also includes features for generating frequency lists, examining n-grams, and identifying patterns of language use across different texts in a corpus.

AntConc is particularly useful for researchers in fields such as language learning and teaching, discourse analysis, and sociolinguistics, as it provides an accessible and user-friendly way to analyze large amounts of language data. Its user interface is intuitive and easy to use, making it a popular choice for both experienced researchers and those new to corpus linguistics.
